The author of **Global Wheat Head Dataset** pursues the goal of automating the process of counting wheat heads with the means of Deep Learning. However, this task is visually complex due to factors like plant overlap, wind-induced blurring, and varying appearances based on maturity, color, genotype, and orientation.

The dataset comprises over 6000 images, each with dimensions of 1024x1024 pixels, containing more than 300,000 distinct wheat heads, each associated with its respective bounding boxes. These images were taken in 11 different countries and cover 44 unique measurement sessions. A measurement session refers to a collection of images captured at a consistent location, within a few hours. Images are captured by diverse ground-based phenotyping platforms and cameras, featuring image acquisition heights ranging from 1.8 m to 3 m above the ground. The dataset encompasses a variety of camera setups, resulting in Ground Sampling Distances (GSDs) varying between 0.10 and 0.62 mm and different field of view angles. While these images are acquired in a nadir-viewing direction, occasional geometric distortion may arise in some sub-datasets due to distinct camera lens characteristics.

The authors of the GWHD dataset emphasized the need to harmonize diverse sub-datasets. To achieve this, they conducted a manual inspection, removing images captured too early in the growth stage when wheat heads were not clearly visible and avoiding those acquired during head senescence to prevent overlapping. Object scale, which is crucial for object detection methods, was influenced by both the object's size (in mm) and image resolution. While wheat head dimensions generally measure around 1.5 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length, the image resolution varied significantly across sub-datasets. To address this, images were rescaled using bilinear interpolation to maintain more uniform resolution at the head level. To align with the requirements of deep learning algorithms, the authors of the dataset divided the original images into square patches. These patches were carefully sized at 1024 x 1024 pixels to minimize the possibility of wheat heads intersecting patch boundaries and being partially cropped. Each patch typically contained approximately 20 to 60 heads, with only a few heads extending beyond the patch boundaries. The number of patches generated from each original image ranged from 1 to 6, depending on the specific sub-dataset.

The authors applied interactive labeling to wheat heads, creating bounding boxes encompassing the entire head pixel area. Labeling posed challenges when heads were not clearly visible due to obstruction by leaves or other heads. Partially hidden heads were only labeled if at least one spikelet was visible, typically occurring in images from the early growth stage when heads were not fully emerged. Head overlap was more common in images from cameras with wider field of view, particularly along the image borders with oblique view angles. In cases where the bounding box was too large to include the awns, it was limited to covering the head itself. Additionally, heads that were cropped at the image edges were labeled only if at least 30% of their basal part was visible. The initial labeling results underwent an independent review by two individuals unaffiliated with the sub-dataset institution. In cases where significant discrepancies between reviewers were identified, an additional round of labeling and reviewing was initiated. Approximately 20 individuals participated in this labeling process, promoting collaboration and repeated reviews to maintain a high level of accuracy and consistency across the sub-datasets.
